The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D\\): Represent the amounts of funds invested in stocks A, B, C, and D, respectively.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize expected return: \\(Z = 0.10x_A + 0.08x_B + 0.06x_C + 0.04x_D\\)\n  - This function calculates the expected return of the entire investment portfolio based on the expected returns of the four stocks and the amounts invested.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Risk tolerance level constraint: \\(5x_A + 4x_B + 3x_C + 2x_D \\leq 150000\\)\n   - This ensures that the sum of the risk levels of the investment portfolio does not exceed the investor's risk tolerance level (15) multiplied by the total investment amount ($10,000).\n2. Total investment amount constraint: \\(x_A + x_B + x_C + x_D = 10000\\)\n   - This ensures that all funds are invested, and the total investment amount is $10,000.\n3. Investment diversification constraint: Investment in at least two stocks.\n   - This can be achieved by adding additional binary variables and corresponding constraints to ensure that at least two investment decision variables are positive.\n4. Non-negativity constraint: \\(x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D \\geq 0\\)\n   - This ensures that the investment amounts are not negative.\n\n### Integer Constraint:\n- \\(x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D\\) must be integers, as investment amounts are typically assumed to be integer values.\n\nTo implement the investment diversification constraint, we can introduce four binary auxiliary variables \\(y_A, y_B, y_C, y_D\\), where \\(y_i = 1\\) if and only if \\(x_i > 0\\) (i.e., if the investor chooses to invest in stock \\(i\\), \\(y_i\\) is 1).\n\nAdditional Constraints:\n- \\(y_A + y_B + y_C + y_D \\geq 2\\)\n- \\(x_i \\leq M \\cdot y_i\\), for all \\(i\\), where \\(M\\) is a sufficiently large number to ensure that if \\(y_i = 0\\), then \\(x_i\\) must also be 0.\n- \\(x_i \\geq \epsilon \\cdot y_i\\), for all \\(i\\), where \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small positive number to ensure that if \\(y_i = 1\\), then \\(x_i\\) must be greater than 0.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal allocation of funds for the investment portfolio, maximizing the expected return while satisfying the risk tolerance level and the requirement of investment diversification. This will provide the investor with an optimal investment strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using coptpy:\nBased on the above mathematical model, we can use the coptpy library to solve this integer linear programming problem.

                      **'completion':**\n"## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the production plant's optimization problem, we will construct an integer linear programming model that aims to maximize the overall output of the production plant while satisfying the wear and tear tolerance level and the requirement of operational diversity. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_P, x_Q, x_R, x_S\\): Represent the amounts of budget allocated to production lines P, Q, R, and S, respectively.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize overall output: \\(Z = 10x_P + 8x_Q + 6x_R + 4x_S\\)\n  - This function calculates the overall output of the entire production plant based on the expected outputs of the four production lines and the amounts allocated.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Wear and tear tolerance level constraint: \\(5x_P + 4x_Q + 3x_R + 2x_S \\leq 150000\\)\n   - This ensures that the sum of the wear and tear levels of the production lines does not exceed the wear and tear tolerance level (15) multiplied by the total budget amount ($10,000).\n2. Total budget amount constraint: \\(x_P + x_Q + x_R + x_S = 10000\\)\n   - This ensures that the entire budget is allocated, and the total budget amount is $10,000.\n3. Operational diversity constraint: Budget allocation to at least two production lines.\n   - This can be achieved by adding additional binary variables and corresponding constraints to ensure that at least two budget allocation decision variables are positive.\n4. Non-negativity constraint: \\(x_P, x_Q, x_R, x_S \\geq 0\\)\n   - This ensures that the budget allocation amounts are not negative.\n\n### Integer Constraint:\n- \\(x_P, x_Q, x_R, x_S\\) must be integers, as budget allocation amounts are typically assumed to be integer values.\n\nTo implement the operational diversity constraint, we can introduce four binary auxiliary variables \\(y_P, y_Q, y_R, y_S\\), where \\(y_i = 1\\) if and only if \\(x_i > 0\\) (i.e., if the plant manager chooses to allocate budget to production line \\(i\\), \\(y_i\\) is 1).\n\nAdditional Constraints:\n- \\(y_P + y_Q + y_R + y_S \\geq 2\\)\n- \\(x_i \\leq M \\cdot y_i\\), for all \\(i\\), where \\(M\\) is a sufficiently large number to ensure that if \\(y_i = 0\\), then \\(x_i\\) must also be 0.\n- \\(x_i \\geq \\epsilon \\cdot y_i\\), for all \\(i\\), where \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small positive number to ensure that if \\(y_i = 1\\), then \\(x_i\\) must be greater than 0.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal allocation of budget for the production plant, maximizing the overall output while satisfying the wear and tear tolerance level and the requirement of operational diversity. This will provide the plant manager with an optimal budget allocation strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using coptpy:\nBased on the above mathematical model, we can use the coptpy library to solve this integer linear programming problem.

The village needs to decide the number of each type of boat to use in order to catch at least 1000 kilograms of fish.\n\nEach A-type boat can catch 200 kilograms of fish per day and requires 10 crew members. Each B-type boat can catch 300 kilograms of fish per day and requires 15 crew members. Each C-type boat can catch 500 kilograms of fish per day and requires 20 crew members. However, due to limited labor in the village, only a maximum of 200 crew members can go fishing each day.\n\nThe cost of operating an A-type boat is 500 yuan, a B-type boat is 800 yuan, and a C-type boat is 1200 yuan. Due to the indivisibility of boats, the quantities of all three types of boats must be integers.\n\nUnder these conditions, what is the minimum total cost that satisfies the fishing needs of the village while adhering to the labor constraint?
