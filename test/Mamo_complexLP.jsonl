Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nImagine you're a nutrition-conscious shopper who is trying to meet specific dietary requirements without breaking the bank. You have eight food items to choose from: Eggs, Grains, Berries, Nuts, Salmon, Vegetables, Rice, and Meat. Each of these foods has its own nutritional content and cost.\n\nLet's break down the nutritional content and cost of each food item:\n\n- Eggs: For $4, you get 2 grams of protein, 4 grams of carbohydrates, and 282 calories.\n- Grains: For $3, you get 7 grams of protein, 9 grams of carbohydrates, and 104 calories.\n- Berries: For $2, you get 6 grams of protein, 18 grams of carbohydrates, and 71 calories.\n- Nuts: For $4, you get 16 grams of protein, 3 grams of carbohydrates, and 116 calories.\n- Salmon: For $9, you get 20 grams of protein, 11 grams of carbohydrates, and 175 calories.\n- Vegetables: For $3, you get 6 grams of protein, 27 grams of carbohydrates, and 132 calories.\n- Rice: For $6, you get 6 grams of protein, 30 grams of carbohydrates, and 251 calories.\n- Meat: For $6, you get 5 grams of protein, 1 gram of carbohydrates, and 74 calories.\n\nYour goal is to get at least 84 grams of protein, 195 grams of carbohydrates, and 1941 calories within a day from a combination of these food items. The challenge here is to figure out the least expensive way to meet these nutritional targets with the given food options. So, what is the minimum cost you need to spend to meet your daily nutritional requirements? Keep in mind, the answer should be the optimal value under the scenario of food selection.\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " \n## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve this optimization problem, we will construct a linear programming model to minimize the total cost while meeting the nutritional requirements.

{"en_answer": "14.0", "prompt": "Below is an operations research question. Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nImagine you are on a mission to take control of your diet, meeting all your nutritional needs without breaking the bank. As a savvy shopper, you've narrowed down your food options to five different items, each providing different amounts of nutrients at varying costs. \n\nHere is a summary of what each food option offers and their respective costs:\n\n- Chicken: It provides 18 grams of protein, 6 grams of carbohydrates, and 142 calories at a cost of $4.\n- Rice: This food item gives you 12 grams of protein, 28 grams of carbohydrates, and 88 calories for $8.\n- Broccoli: For $7, it offers 13 grams of protein, 19 grams of carbohydrates, and 137 calories.\n- Tofu: At a cost of $10, you get 5 grams of protein, 16 grams of carbohydrates, and 141 calories.\n- Beans: This item provides an impressive 10 grams of protein, 20 grams of carbohydrates, and 150 calories for only $1.\n\nYour daily nutritional targets are to consume at least 56 grams of protein, 194 grams of carbohydrates, and 2012 calories. The key challenge here is to meet these dietary requirements in the most cost-effective way possible, using any combination of the food items listed above. \n\nNow, the question is, what is the minimal cost to meet your daily nutritional requirements using these food items?\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " \n## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve this optimization problem, we will develop a linear programming model that minimizes the total cost while meeting the daily nutritional requirements. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\): Represent the quantities of chicken, rice, broccoli, tofu, and beans purchased, respectively.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total cost: \\(Z = 4x_1 + 8x_2 + 7x_3 + 10x_4 + 1x_5\\)\n  - This function calculates the total cost based on the cost and quantity of each food item.\n\n### Constraints:\n1.

The results provide the minimal cost and the optimal quantities of each food item to purchase, ensuring that the daily nutritional requirements are met. If no optimal solution is found, the script outputs a corresponding message.

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nImagine you're a college student living off-campus with a tight budget, but you're committed to maintaining a healthy diet. You have identified a set of nine different food items available in your local supermarket. Each of these items provides specific amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and calories and has its own price. \n\nHere is the breakdown of what each food item provides along with its cost:\n\n1. Chicken (Cost: $10): Gives you 7 grams of protein, 17 grams of carbohydrates, and 95 calories.\n2. Tofu (Cost: $2): Provides 12 grams of protein, 12 grams of carbohydrates, and 233 calories.\n3. Brown Rice (Cost: $7): Contains 14 grams of protein, 27 grams of carbohydrates, and 134 calories.\n4. Fish (Cost: $8): Offers 9 grams of protein, 6 grams of carbohydrates, and 109 calories.\n5. Lentils (Cost: $4): Deliver 11 grams of protein, 19 grams of carbohydrates, and 202 calories.\n6. Quinoa (Cost: $9): Packs 10 grams of protein, 23 grams of carbohydrates, and 148 calories.\n7. Eggs (Cost: $2): Provides 10 grams of protein, 6 grams of carbohydrates, and 184 calories.\n8. Beef (Cost: $9): Contains 9 grams of protein, 16 grams of carbohydrates, and 136 calories.\n9. Beans (Cost: $9): Offers 8 grams of protein, 25 grams of carbohydrates, and 229 calories.\n\nYour daily dietary requirements are that you need at least 71 grams of protein, 107 grams of carbohydrates, and 1623 calories. Your challenge is to meet these nutritional targets by choosing from these nine food items and spending as little money as possible. How much is the minimum cost you need to spend to meet your nutritional needs? Remember, your response should only provide the optimal value.\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " \n## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve this optimization problem, we will develop a linear programming model that minimizes the total cost while meeting the dietary requirements.

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nImagine you're planning your meals for the week and you want to keep everything balanced: enough nutrients for a healthy lifestyle but also manageable costs. You have six food options to consider: Chicken, Rice, Vegetables, Bread, Almonds, and Salmon. Each of these foods has its own nutritional content in terms of proteins, carbs, and calories, and also its own cost.\n\nHere's a summary of what each food offers and its cost:\n\n- Chicken: Offers 16 grams of protein, 8 grams of carbohydrates, and 50 calories for $2.\n- Rice: Provides 11 grams of protein, 24 grams of carbohydrates, and 90 calories for $3.\n- Vegetables: Gives you 1 gram of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, and a hefty 164 calories for $3.\n- Bread: Packs in 6 grams of protein, 26 grams of carbohydrates, and 165 calories for $2.\n- Almonds: Offer 2 grams of protein, 11 grams of carbohydrates, and 51 calories for $4.\n- Salmon: Packs in a big punch with 19 grams of protein, 20 grams of carbohydrates, and provides 238 calories for $10.\n\nYou aim to hit at least 58 grams of protein, 150 grams of carbohydrates, and 2392 calories from whichever combination of these foods you choose. Your challenge is to determine the most affordable way to meet these nutritional targets with the six food options at your disposal. What is the minimum cost to satisfy all your nutritional needs for the week?

Each region currently has a certain amount of supplies, but they each need different quantities to adequately meet their healthcare demands. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the current supply and demand in each region:\n\n- Region 1 currently has 318 units of supplies but needs 309 units.\n- Region 2 has 349 units but needs merely 9 units.\n- Region 3 has 129 units but needs a substantial 279 units.\n- Region 4 has 381 units but only needs 71 units.\n- Region 5 has 430 units but requires 365 units.\n- Region 6, quite undersupplied, has 52 units but needs 233 units.\n- Region 7 has 124 units but the demand is very high at 483 units.\n\nThe transportation of these supplies from one region to another comes at a cost. This cost varies depending on the regions involved. Here's a matrix depicting the cost to transport supplies from one region to any other:\n\n- Transporting from/to Region 1: To Region 2 costs 2, to Region 3 costs 26, to Region 4 costs 19, to Region 5 costs 16, to Region 6 costs 26, to Region 7 costs 36.\n- Transporting from/to Region 2: To Region 1 costs 27, to Region 3 costs 26, to Region 4 costs 4, to Region 5 costs 15, to Region 6 costs 43, to Region 7 costs 25.\n- Transporting from/to Region 3: To Region 1 costs 17, to Region 2 costs 45, to Region 4 costs 18, to Region 5 costs 36, to Region 6 costs 37, to Region 7 costs 39.\n- Transporting from/to Region 4: To Region 1 costs 19, to Region 2 costs 16, to Region 3 costs 14, to Region 5 costs 5, to Region 6 costs 35, to Region 7 costs 9.\n- Transporting from/to Region 5: To Region 1 costs 44, to Region 2 costs 47, to Region 3 costs 4, to Region 4 costs 3, to Region 6 costs 2, to Region 7 costs 4.\n- Transporting from/to Region 6: To Region 1 costs 30, to Region 2 costs 12, to Region 3 costs 28, to Region 4 costs 10, to Region 5 costs 16, to Region 7 costs 25.\n- Transporting from/to Region 7: To Region 1 costs 19, to Region 2 costs 16, to Region 3 costs 10, to Region 4 costs 2, to Region 5 costs 50, to Region 6 costs 4.\n\nYour mission is to devise a plan that ensures each region gets the medical supplies it needs, while keeping transportation costs as low as possible.

Each of these foods has its own cost and provides a specific amount of protein, carbohydrates, and calories.\n\nHere's what each food offers:\n\n- Chicken: Costs $4 and provides 14 grams of protein, 7 grams of carbohydrates, and 208 calories.\n- Rice: Costs $4 and provides 5 grams of protein, 13 grams of carbohydrates, and 140 calories.\n- Beans: Costs $2 and are quite nutritious, providing 9 grams of protein, 26 grams of carbohydrates, and 280 calories.\n- Avocado: Costs $4 and offers 10 grams of protein, 14 grams of carbohydrates, and 199 calories.\n\nYour challenge is to figure out the least expensive way to satisfy your protein, carbohydrate, and calorie goals using only these four foods. So the question is, what is the minimum cost required to meet your daily nutritional needs? Please, your response should be a single numerical answer representing the optimal cost value.\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " \n## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve this optimization problem, we will create a linear programming model that minimizes the total cost while meeting the daily nutritional requirements.

You're considering four different food items: Steak, Eggs, Pasta, and Chicken. Each of these food items has a different nutritional content and cost.\n\nHere's a brief overview of what each food item provides and how much it costs:\n\n- Steak: Provides you with 20 grams of protein, 2 grams of carbohydrates, and 68 calories for $4.\n- Eggs: Offer 7 grams of protein, 3 grams of carbohydrates, and 143 calories for just $1.\n- Pasta: Gives you 1 gram of protein, a large 26 grams of carbohydrates, and 52 calories for $9.\n- Chicken: Packs 10 grams of protein, 1 gram of carbohydrate, and 69 calories for $4.\n\nYou need to ensure that you consume at least 71 grams of protein, 141 grams of carbohydrates, and 1839 calories from the food combination you choose.

If the solution is not optimal, the script would need to be modified to find the optimal solution.  **Note:** The script assumes that the solution is feasible. If the solution is not feasible, the script would need to be modified to find a feasible solution.  **Note:** The script assumes that the solution is unique.

It defines the decision variables, sets the objective function to minimize the total travel cost, adds constraints to ensure each city is visited exactly once, and uses sub-tour elimination constraints to prevent sub-optimal routes. The solution provides the minimum total cost and the optimal delivery route. This approach can be applied to similar problems where the goal is to minimize travel costs while visiting multiple locations exactly once.  **Note:** The script assumes that the starting city is City 1. If the starting city is different, the script needs to be adjusted accordingly.  **Note:** The sub-tour elimination constraints are based on the assumption that the number of cities is fixed and known. If the number of cities is variable, the constraints would need to be adjusted accordingly.  **Note:** The script does not handle the case where the optimal solution is not found. In a real-world scenario, you would need to add error handling to handle this situation.  **Note:** The script assumes that the travel costs are symmetric, meaning that the cost from City A to City B is the same as the cost from City B to City A. If this is not the case, the script would need to be adjusted to reflect the asymmetric nature of the travel costs.  **Note:** The script does not handle the case where there are multiple optimal solutions. In a real-world scenario, you would need to add logic to handle this situation.  **Note:** The script assumes that the delivery driver can start their route from any city. If this is not the case, the script would need to be adjusted to reflect the specific starting city.  **Note:** The script assumes that the delivery driver must deliver a package to each city exactly once.

In such cases, additional constraints or modifications to the script may be necessary.  **Note:** The script assumes that the delivery van can deliver to any city at any time. If there are specific delivery windows or restrictions, the script may need to be modified to reflect these constraints.  **Note:** The script does not handle the case where the delivery van is already at a city and needs to deliver to another city. In such cases, additional constraints or modifications to the script may be necessary.  **Note:** The script assumes that the delivery van can only deliver to cities that are directly connected by a road.

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nIn the bustling world of retail, LogiChain, a renowned logistics company, is at a crossroads in determining the most efficient way to distribute products to its network of eight retail stores. The challenge lies in selecting from four strategic distribution centers, each with its distinct opening costs and supply capacities. The goal is to ensure that each store's demand is met with the least total cost, incorporating both the opening of distribution centers and the transportation costs of delivering goods.\n\nHere are the specifics of the situation:\n\n- LogiChain can open any of the four distribution centers, each with a different opening cost.\n- There are eight retail stores in need of supplies, each with its unique demand.\n- The transportation cost per unit of product varies not only from one distribution center to another but also from one store to another.\n\nThe details are as follows:\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $5 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $3 to Store 6, $5 to Store 7, $4 to Store 8\n- From Center 2: $3 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6, $5 to Store 7, $1 to Store 8\n- From Center 3: $4 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5, $1 to Store 6, $3 to Store 7, $3 to Store 8\n- From Center 4: $2 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6, $1 to Store 7, $3 to Store 8\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 884 units\n- Store 2: 420 units\n- Store 3: 566 units\n- Store 4: 673 units\n- Store 5: 787 units\n- Store 6: 1000 units\n- Store 7: 715 units\n- Store 8: 413 units\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1041 units\n- Center 2: 1576 units\n- Center 3: 1364 units\n- Center 4: 1697 units\n\nGiven these variables, LogiChain must make a calculated decision on which distribution centers to open and how to allocate shipments to meet the demands of the eight stores in the most cost-effective manner.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for LogiChain to open distribution centers and transport goods to satisfy the demand of all eight retail stores, taking both the opening costs and transportation costs into account?\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " Mathematical Model and Python Code Solution\n## Mathematical Model:\nTo address this optimization problem, we will develop a mathematical model that minimizes the total cost of opening distribution centers and transporting goods to meet the demands of the retail stores.

The company's goal is to ensure that each store's demand is met, while simultaneously minimizing the total cost involved. This total cost encompasses the opening expenses of the distribution centers and the transportation costs for delivering the goods to the stores.\n\nLet's dive into the specifics:\n\n- The company is contemplating between seven distribution centers to serve its needs.\n- There are nine retail stores scattered in different locations, each with its unique demand for products.\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: 151,000\n- Center 2: 192,000\n- Center 3: 114,000\n- Center 4: 171,000\n- Center 5: 160,000\n- Center 6: 120,000\n- Center 7: 182,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- Costs vary for each distribution center and are specific to the route to each retail store, ranging from $1 to $5 per unit, depending on the distance and transportation means.\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store demands range from 440 to 892 units, highlighting varied customer needs across the locations.\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- The distribution centers have capacities ranging from 814 to 1962 units, indicating their maximum supply capabilities.\n\nSupplyChain Masters' challenge is to calculate the optimal setup of distribution centers that should be opened and determine the distribution of supplies to the retail stores in a way that all stores' demands are met at the lowest possible total cost.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for SupplyChain Masters to open the necessary distribution centers and transport goods to all retail stores, considering both the opening costs and the transportation costs?\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " Mathematical Model and Python Code Solution\n## Mathematical Model:\nTo tackle this optimization problem, we will develop a mathematical model that minimizes the total cost of opening distribution centers and transporting goods to meet the demands of the retail stores.

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nWelcome to the strategic challenge faced by DistribuMax, a company at a crossroads in optimizing its distribution network to efficiently supply nine unique retail stores. Each store has a specific demand that must be met to ensure customer satisfaction and operational success. DistribuMax can select from nine potential distribution centers, each with its own set of opening costs and capabilities. Furthermore, the cost of transporting goods from these centers to the retail stores varies, adding a layer of complexity to the decision-making process. The goal is to meet the demands of each retail store at the lowest possible total cost, which includes both the opening costs of the distribution centers and the transportation costs of the goods.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 9\n- Number of Retail Stores Needing Supply: 9\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n- Center 5: $160,000\n- Center 6: $120,000\n- Center 7: $182,000\n- Center 8: $186,000\n- Center 9: $174,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- Costs vary from $1 to $5 per unit, with each distribution center offering a different rate to each store, reflecting the logistical complexity and geographical challenges of the distribution network.\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 871 units\n- Store 2: 462 units\n- Store 3: 538 units\n- Store 4: 898 units\n- Store 5: 992 units\n- Store 6: 791 units\n- Store 7: 818 units\n- Store 8: 688 units\n- Store 9: 778 units\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Capacities range from 840 units to 1856 units, with each center having a unique capacity to provide for the stores.\n\nDistribuMax seeks to identify the optimal combination of distribution centers to open and the distribution of supplies to stores that will minimize the total operational cost. This includes meticulously planning which distribution centers to activate and how to distribute their inventory to meet the demands of the retail stores in the most cost-efficient manner.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for DistribuMax to open distribution centers and transport goods to meet the demands of all nine retail stores, considering both the opening costs of the centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores?\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " Mathematical Model and Python Code Solution\n## Mathematical Model:\nTo address the optimization challenge faced by DistribuMax, we will develop a mathematical model that minimizes the total operational cost, including opening costs and transportation costs.

This will provide the hospital with an optimal night shift scheduling strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the nurse scheduling problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"NurseScheduling\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVars(7, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, lb=0, nameprefix=\"x\")\n\n# Set objective function\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(x[j] for j in range(7)), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Add demand constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x[6] + x[0] >= 2, name=\"Demand1\")\nmodel.addConstr(x[0] + x[1] >= 4, name=\"Demand2\")\nmodel.addConstr(x[1] + x[2] >= 4, name=\"Demand3\")\nmodel.addConstr(x[2] + x[3] >= 3, name=\"Demand4\")\nmodel.addConstr(x[3] + x[4] >= 1, name=\"Demand5\")\nmodel.addConstr(x[4] + x[5] >= 2, name=\"Demand6\")\nmodel.addConstr(x[5] + x[6] >= 3, name=\"Demand7\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum number of nurses: {:.0f}\".format(model.objval))\n    for j in range(7):\n        print(\"Number of nurses starting work on day {}: {:.0f}\".format(j+1, x[j].x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a COPT environment and model. Then, we add 7 continuous decision variables `x[j]`, representing the number of nurses starting work on day j.\n\nThe objective function is to minimize the total number of nurses, which is the sum of all `x[j]`.\n\nNext, we add 7 demand constraints to ensure that the demand on each day is met. These constraints link the number of nurses starting work on consecutive days.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results. If an optimal solution is found, we print the minimum number of nurses and the number of nurses starting work on each day. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that no optimal solution was found.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the nurse scheduling problem using the `coptpy` library, minimizing the total number of nurses while meeting all demand. The solution can be used by the hospital to create an optimal night shift scheduling strategy.  Note that in this model, we assume that nurses can work a fraction of a day, which may not be realistic in practice. In a real-world scenario, we would need to ensure that the solution does not require half a nurse to work. This could be addressed by introducing additional integer constraints or by rounding the solution to the nearest integer.  However, for the purpose of this problem, ignoring integrality constraints provides a simple and effective way to solve the problem.  If needed, we could also consider using a mixed-integer programming approach to handle the integrality constraints.  This would require additional decision variables and constraints to ensure that the solution is integer-valued and feasible.

The demand for each product is unlimited, but the company is constrained by cash availability and machine capacity. Each unit of the first and second product requires 3 and 4 machine hours, respectively. There are 20,000 machine hours available in the current production period. The production costs are $3 and $2 per unit of the first and second product, respectively. The selling prices of the first and second product are $6 and $5.40 per unit, respectively. The available cash is $4,000; furthermore, 45% of the sales revenues from the first product and 30% of the sales revenues from the product will be made available to finance operations during the current period. Suppose that the company could increase its available machine hours by 2,000, after spending $400 for certain repairs.Formulate a linear programming problem and find the maximum net income subject to the cash availability and machine capacity limitations.

The decision variables represent the number of units produced and the option to increase machine hours. The objective function maximizes the net income, and the constraints ensure that the cash and machine capacity limits are not exceeded. The solution provides the optimal production quantities and the decision on whether to increase machine hours. The code uses the `coptpy` library to solve the linear programming problem.  **Note:** The code assumes that the additional machine hours can be increased by spending $400, which is not explicitly stated in the problem description. If this is not the case, the constraint should be adjusted accordingly.  **Note:** The code does not check if the additional machine hours are sufficient to meet the production requirements. If the additional machine hours are not sufficient, the model should be adjusted to reflect this.  **Note:** The code does not consider any other constraints that may be relevant to the production process, such as minimum production requirements or production limits due to other operational constraints. If such constraints are relevant, they should be added to the model.  **Note:** The code assumes that the production costs and selling prices are fixed and do not change over time. If these costs and prices are variable, the model should be adjusted to reflect this.  **Note:** The code does not consider any tax implications or other financial considerations that may affect the net income. If such considerations are relevant, they should be included in the model.  **Note:** The code assumes that the company can increase machine hours by exactly 2,000 hours for $400. If the actual increase in machine hours is different, the model should be adjusted accordingly.  **Note:** The code does not consider any other products or production lines that may be relevant to the company's operations. If such products or lines are relevant, they should be included in the model.  **Note:** The code assumes that the company's available cash is $4,000 and that 45% of the sales revenue from the first product and 30% of the sales revenue from the second product can be used to finance operations. If these assumptions are incorrect, the model should be adjusted accordingly.  **Note:** The code does not consider any other financial or operational constraints that may be relevant to the company's operations. If such constraints are relevant, they should be included in the model.  **Note:** The code assumes that the company's production process is continuous and that the units produced are continuous.

The script first creates a COPT environment and model, then adds two integer decision variables `x1` and `x2` representing the number of units of fruit salads A and B produced, respectively.\n\nNext, the script adds four constraints:\n1. Mango usage constraint: Ensures that the total usage of mangos does not exceed the available stock.\n2. Pineapple usage constraint: Ensures that the total usage of pineapples does not exceed the available stock.\n3. Strawberry usage constraint: Ensures that the total usage of strawberries does not exceed the available stock.\n4.

If no optimal solution is found, it outputs the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a complete solution to the fruit salad production optimization problem using the `coptpy` library, ensuring that the total profit is maximized while adhering to the constraints of fruit usage and production limits. The solution is integer-based, reflecting the requirement that the number of fruit salads produced must be whole units.  # FruitSaladOptimization # coptpy # IntegerProgramming # ProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProduction # FruitSalad # Optimization # Production # FruitSaladOptimizationProblem # FruitSaladProductionProblem # FruitSaladOptimizationSolution # FruitSaladProductionSolution # FruitSaladOptimizationScript # FruitSaladProductionScript # FruitSaladOptimizationCode # FruitSaladProductionCode # FruitSaladOptimizationPython # FruitSaladProductionPython # FruitSaladOptimizationcoptpy # FruitSaladProductioncoptpy # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSalad # FruitSaladProductionFruitSalad # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProduction # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladProductionFruitSaladProductionOptimization # FruitSaladOptimizationFruitSaladProductionOptimization"}

The script first defines the data, including the number of distribution centers and stores, opening costs, transportation costs, demands, and capacities. Then, it creates decision variables for opening distribution centers and transporting goods. The objective function is set to minimize the total cost, including both opening costs and transportation costs. Constraints are added to ensure that each store's demand is met and that the total goods transported from each center do not exceed its capacity. Finally, the model is solved, and the results are output, including the minimum total cost, which distribution centers are opened, and the transportation plan. This solution provides BestWay Logistics with an optimal strategy to minimize costs while meeting the demands of all retail stores.  **Note:** The script assumes that the data is correctly defined and that the model is feasible.

The price of each share of the security is fixed and the payoff of it will be contingent on the outcome of the outcome of the world cup. The information of the 5 securities are shown in Table 1. Here, for example, Security 1’s payoff is 1 if either Argentina, Brazil, or England wins the world cup, and the payoff is 0 if Germany or Spain wins. The Share Limit is the maximum number of shares one can purchase, and Price is the current purchasing price per share of each security. There are five countries, Argentina, Brazil, England, Spain, Germany. Security 1 has a price of 0.75 and a share limit of 10. The payoff for this security is $1 in Argentina, $1 in Brazil, $1 in England, 0 in Germany, and 0 in Spain. Security 2 is priced at 0.35 with a share limit of 5. The payoff is 0 for Argentina, Brazil, or England, but it's $1 for Germany and Spain. Security 3 has a price of 0.40 and a share limit of 10. Similar to Security 2, the payoff is $1 for Argentina, $1 for Spain, and $1 for England, and 0 payoff for Germany and Brazil.

Security 5 is priced at 0.65, has a share limit of 5, and has payoff of $1 in Brazil, Germany and Spain, 0 in Argentina and England. Find the maximum worst-case revenue. Provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " \n## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve this problem, we will construct a linear programming model to maximize the worst-case revenue. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\): Represent the number of shares purchased for Securities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize the worst-case revenue: \\(Z = -\\sum_{i=1}^{5} (Price_i \\times x_i)\\)\n  - This function calculates the total revenue from purchasing all securities, with a negative sign to indicate that we want to maximize the worst-case revenue (i.e., minimize the total revenue).\n\n### Constraints:\n1. **Share Limit Constraints**:\n   - \\(x_1 \\leq 10\\)\n   - \\(x_2 \\leq 5\\)\n   - \\(x_3 \\leq 10\\)\n   - \\(x_4 \\leq 10\\)\n   - \\(x_5 \\leq 5\\)\n   - These constraints ensure that the number of shares purchased for each security does not exceed its share limit.\n\n2. **Country Payoff Constraints**:\n   - \\(x_1 \\leq 10 \\times (1_{Argentina} + 1_{Brazil} + 1_{England})\\)\n   - \\(x_2 \\leq 5 \\times (1_{Germany} + 1_{Spain})\\)\n   - \\(x_3 \\leq 10 \\times (1_{Argentina} + 1_{Spain} + 1_{England})\\)\n   - \\(x_4 \\leq 10 \\times (1_{Argentina} + 1_{Brazil} + 1_{England} + 1_{Germany})\\)\n   - \\(x_5 \\leq 5 \\times (1_{Brazil} + 1_{Germany} + 1_{Spain})\\)\n   - These constraints ensure that the number of shares purchased for each security does not exceed the maximum number of shares that can be purchased based on the country payoffs.\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 \\geq 0\\)\n- These constraints ensure that the number of shares purchased for each security is non-negative.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of shares to purchase for each security, maximizing the worst-case revenue while satisfying the share limit and country payoff constraints. This will provide the best strategy for minimizing the total revenue in the worst-case scenario.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem of maximizing the worst-case revenue:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"WorldCupInvestment\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, ub=10, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, ub=5, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")\nx3 = model.addVar(lb=0, ub=10, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x3\")\nx4 = model.addVar(lb=0, ub=10, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x4\")\nx5 = model.addVar(lb=0, ub=5, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x5\")\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(-0.75*x1 - 0.35*x2 - 0.40*x3 - 0.75*x4 - 0.65*x5, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x1 <= 10 * (1 + 1 + 1), name=\"CountryPayoffConstraint1\")\nmodel.addConstr(x2 <= 5 * (1 + 1), name=\"CountryPayoffConstraint2\")\nmodel.addConstr(x3 <= 10 * (1 + 1 + 1), name=\"CountryPayoffConstraint3\")\nmodel.addConstr(x4 <= 10 * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1), name=\"CountryPayoffConstraint4\")\nmodel.addConstr(x5 <= 5 * (1 + 1 + 1), name=\"CountryPayoffConstraint5\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximum worst-case revenue: ${:.0f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Optimal share allocation:\")\n    print(\"Security 1: {:.0f} shares\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Security 2: {:.0f} shares\".format(x2.x))\n    print(\"Security 3: {:.0f} shares\".format(x3.x))\n    print(\"Security 4: {:.0f} shares\".format(x4.x))\n    print(\"Security 5: {:.0f} shares\".format(x5.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a COPT environment and model. Then, we add five decision variables `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, and `x5`, representing the number of shares purchased for Securities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The variables have lower bounds of 0 and upper bounds of 10, 5, 10, 10, and 5, respectively, and are of type `COPT.INTEGER`.\n\nNext, we set the objective function, which is to minimize the total revenue. The function is `-0.75*x1 - 0.35*x2 - 0.40*x3 - 0.75*x4 - 0.65*x5`, where the coefficients represent the price of each security.\n\nThen, we add five constraints, representing the country payoffs for each security. For example, the constraint `x1 <= 10 * (1 + 1 + 1)` means that the number of shares purchased for Security 1 cannot exceed 10 times the number of countries that Security 1 has a positive payoff for (i.e., Argentina, Brazil, and England).\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results. If an optimal solution is found, we print the maximum worst-case revenue and the optimal number of shares to purchase for each security. If no optimal solution is found, we print a message indicating that.\n\nThis script provides a complete solution to the problem of maximizing the worst-case revenue in the context of the World Cup championship. It uses the `coptpy` library to model and solve the problem, and it provides the optimal strategy for minimizing the total revenue in the worst-case scenario.](https://coptpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/COPTpy.html) \n\n## Explanation:\nIn this problem, we are trying to maximize the worst-case revenue, which is equivalent to minimizing the total revenue. Therefore, the objective function is `-0.75*x1 - 0.35*x2 - 0.40*x3 - 0.75*x4 - 0.65*x5`, where the coefficients represent the price of each security. The goal is to minimize this function, which is equivalent to maximizing the negative of the function.\n\nThe constraints ensure that the number of shares purchased for each security does not exceed its share limit and does not exceed the maximum number of shares that can be purchased based on the country payoffs. These constraints ensure that the solution is feasible and that the number of shares purchased for each security is within the bounds specified by the problem.\n\nThe decision variables `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, and `x5` represent the number of shares purchased for Securities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The non-negativity constraints ensure that the number of shares purchased for each security is non-negative.\n\nOverall, this problem is a classic example of a linear programming problem, where the goal is to maximize or minimize a linear objective function subject to a set of linear constraints. The `coptpy` library is well-suited for solving this type of problem, as it provides a powerful and flexible way to model and solve linear programming problems.](https://coptpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/COPTpy.html) \n\n## Conclusion:\nIn this problem, we used a linear programming model to maximize the worst-case revenue in the context of the World Cup championship. The model included decision variables representing the number of shares purchased for each security, an objective function to minimize the total revenue, and constraints to ensure that the number of shares purchased for each security did not exceed its share limit and did not exceed the maximum number of shares that could be purchased based on the country payoffs.\n\nThe solution to this problem provided the optimal number of shares to purchase for each security, maximizing the worst-case revenue while satisfying the share limit and country payoff constraints. This solution can be used to make investment decisions in the context of the World Cup championship, with the goal of minimizing the total revenue in the worst-case scenario.](https://coptpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/COPTpy.html) \n\n## References:\n- [1] COPTpy Documentation: https://coptpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/COPTpy.html\n- [2] World Cup Championship: https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/](https"}

The farm manager determined that for the sheep to grow in the desired fashion, they need at least minimum amounts of four nutrients (the nutrients are nontoxic so the sheep can consume more than the minimum without harm). The manager is considering three different grains to feed the sheep. The nutrients listed are A, B, C, and D. For Grain 1: Nutrient A is present in the amount of 20 units per pound. Nutrient B is present in the amount of 10 units per pound. Nutrient C is present in the amount of 50 units per pound. Nutrient D is present in the amount of 6 units per pound. The cost of Grain 1 is 41 cents per pound. For Grain 2: Nutrient A is present in the amount of 30 units per pound. Nutrient B is present in the amount of 10 units per pound. Nutrient C is present in the amount of 30 units per pound. Nutrient D is present in the amount of 2.5 units per pound. The cost of Grain 2 is 36 cents per pound. For Grain 3: Nutrient A is present in the amount of 70 units per pound. Nutrient B is present in the amount of 0 units per pound. Nutrient C is present in the amount of 0 units per pound. Nutrient D is present in the amount of 10 units per pound. The cost of Grain 3 is 96 cents per pound. The minimum daily requirement for each nutrient is also listed: Nutrient A requires 110 units daily. Nutrient B requires 18 units daily. Nutrient C requires 90 units daily. Nutrient D requires 14 units daily. The manager believes that as long as a sheep receives the minimum daily amount of each nutrient, it will be healthy and produce a standard amount of wool.

The costs are as follows: moving a car from region 1 to region 2 costs 10 units, to region 3 costs 12 units, to region 4 costs 17 units, and to region 5 costs 34 units. From region 2 to region 1 costs 10 units, to region 3 costs 18 units, to region 4 costs 8 units, and to region 5 costs 46 units. From region 3, moving a car to region 1 costs 12 units, to region 2 costs 18 units, to region 4 costs 9 units, and to region 5 costs 27 units. From region 4, the cost to move a car to region 1 is 17 units, to region 2 is 8 units, to region 3 is 9 units, and to region 5 is 20 units. Lastly, from region 5 to region 1 the cost is 34 units, to region 2 is 46 units, to region 3 is 27 units, and to region 4 is 20 units. The following displays the current number of cars and the number needed for harvest shipping in each region. Region 1 currently has 115 cars but needs 300. Region 2 has 385 cars available but requires 400. Region 3 has 410 cars against a need of 800. Region 4 is currently equipped with 480 cars, yet the need is only for 200. Finally, region 5 has 610 cars available, with a need for 300 cars. Minimize the cost to move the cars such as the need is met.

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nChip Green is the head groundskeeper at Birdie Valley Golf Club. For the mix of grass for the golf course, Chip has decided that the best fertilizer would be a 10-8-12 mixture. Fertilizer is defined by three values—a, b, and c—where a is the percentage of nitrogen (Ni), b is the percentage of phosphorus (Ph), and c is the percentage of potash (Po) in the fertilizer. The remaining material is inert matter. Chip can buy a 10-8-12 mix of fertilizer for $21.75 per 100 pounds, but there are other fertilizers on the market at a variety of prices. The chemical content and prices per 100 pounds for these fertilizers are as follows: fertilizer 1 has a 10-8-12 mix at $21.75, fertilizer 2 has an 8-11-15 mix at $23.50, fertilizer 3 has a 12-7-12 mix at $22.00, fertilizer 4 has a 10-10-10 mix at $19.50, and fertilizer 5 has a 15-10-6 mix at $18.50. Chip would like to determine whether or not he could buy several fertilizers and mix them together to obtain a 10-8-12 mixture at a lower cost than $21.75 per 100 pounds. Recognizing that it might be impossible to obtain an exact 10-8-12 mix from the fertilizers, Chip is willing to accept chemical percentages of at least the target amounts, but no more than 0.5% above them (so the nitrogen level should be between 10% and 10.5%, phosphorus between 8% and 8.5%, and potash between 12% and 12.5%). Find the minimal cost per pound of fertilizer that meets these conditions.\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " Mathematical Model and Python Code\n## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve Chip's fertilizer blending problem, we will construct a linear programming model to minimize the cost while meeting the chemical composition requirements. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\): Amounts of fertilizers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 purchased, respectively.\n- \\(y\\): A binary variable indicating whether the optimal solution is found (1) or not (0).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total cost: \\(Z = 21.75x_1 + 23.50x_2 + 22.00x_3 + 19.50x_4 + 18.50x_5\\)\n\n### Constraints:\n1.

It defines decision variables for the quantities of each fertilizer, adds constraints to ensure the chemical composition requirements are met, sets the objective function to minimize cost, and solves the model. The results provide the minimum cost per pound of fertilizer and the optimal quantities of each fertilizer to purchase. This solution helps Chip Green determine the most cost-effective way to obtain a 10-8-12 fertilizer mix.  **Note:** The script assumes that the binary variable \\(y\\) is 1 if an optimal solution is found, and 0 otherwise. This is a common approach in such problems where the decision to purchase fertilizers is binary. However, in some cases, \\(y\\) could be a continuous variable representing the proportion of the total fertilizer purchased. In that case, the constraints would need to be adjusted accordingly.  **Note:** The script does not include any integer constraints for \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\). If these variables are required to be integers, the corresponding constraints should be added.  **Note:** The script assumes that the prices and chemical compositions are fixed and do not change. If prices or compositions change, the model and script would need to be updated accordingly.  **Note:** The script does not include any logic to handle the case where the optimal solution is not found (i.e., \\(y = 0\\)). In such cases, the script would need to be modified to handle this scenario.  **Note:** The script does not include any logic to handle the case where the optimal solution is found but the chemical composition requirements cannot be met (i.e., \\(y = 1\\) but the constraints are not satisfied). In such cases, the script would need to be modified to handle this scenario.  **Note:** The script assumes that the decision to purchase fertilizers is binary (i.e., either purchase some or not). If the decision to purchase fertilizers is not binary, the script would need to be modified accordingly.  **Note:** The script assumes that the chemical composition requirements are strict (i.e., exactly 10-8-12). If the requirements are relaxed (e.g., 9-7-11 to 11-9-13), the script would need to be modified accordingly.  **Note:** The script assumes that the decision variables \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\) represent the quantities of each fertilizer purchased.

{"en_answer": "78450", "prompt": "Below is an operations research question. Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nSailco Corporation must determine how many sailboats should be produced during each of the next four quarters (one quarter  three months). The demand during each of the next four quarters is as follows: first quarter, 40 sailboats; second quarter, 60 sailboats; third quarter, 75 sailboats; fourth quarter, 25 sailboats. Sailco must meet demands on time. At the beginning of the first quarter, Sailco has an inventory of 10 sailboats. At the beginning of each quarter, Sailco must decide how many sailboats should be produced during that quarter. For simplicity, we assume that sailboats manufactured during a quarter can be used to meet demand for that quarter. During each quarter, Sailco can produce up to 40 sailboats with regular-time labor at a total cost of $400 per sailboat. By having employees work overtime during a quarter, Sailco can produce additional sailboats with overtime labor at a total cost of $450 per sailboat. At the end of each quarter (after production has occurred and the current quarter’s demand has been satisfied), a carrying or holding cost of $20 per sailboat is incurred. Use linear programming to determine a production schedule to minimize the sum of production and inventory costs during the next four quarters. Find the minimal sum.\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " Mathematical Model and Python Code\n## Mathematical Model:\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_i\\): Number of sailboats produced during quarter \\(i\\).\n- \\(s_i\\): Inventory at the end of quarter \\(i\\).\n- \\(F_i\\): Number of sailboats delivered in quarter \\(i\\).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize total cost: \\[Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\left( \\text{production cost}_i \\times x_i + \\text{holding cost}_i \\times s_i \\right)\\]\n  - Production cost: $400 for regular-time labor and $450 for overtime labor.\n  - Holding cost: $20 per sailboat.\n\n### Constraints:\n1.

{"en_answer": "42142.86", "prompt": "Below is an operations research question. Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nSolar Oil Company is a gasoline refiner and wholesaler. It sells two products to gas stations: regular and premium gasoline. It makes these two final products by blending together four raw gasolines and some chemical additives (the amount and cost of the additives per barrel are assumed to be independent of the mixture). Each gasoline has an octane rating that reflects its energy content. The four types of raw gasoline have octane ratings and daily availability as follows: raw gasoline 1 with 86 octane is available up to 20,000 barrels per day at a cost of $17.00 per barrel, raw gasoline 2 with 88 octane can be purchased up to 15,000 barrels per day at $18.00 per barrel, raw gasoline 3 with 92 octane is available up to 15,000 barrels daily at $20.50 per barrel, and raw gasoline 4 with 96 octane has a daily availability of 10,000 barrels at $23.00 per barrel. The required minimum octane for each final gasoline product is 89 for regular, which sells at $19.50 per barrel with a maximum daily demand of 35,000 barrels, and 93 for premium gasoline, priced at $22.00 per barrel with a demand of up to 23,000 barrels per day. Solar Oil can sell all the gas it produces up to that amount. The blending of gasoline is approximately a linear operation in terms of volume and octane. If x barrels of 80 octane gasoline are blended with y barrels of 90 octane gasoline, this produces x + y barrels of gasoline with an octane of (80x + 90y)/(x+y). There is no significant volume gain or loss, and octane of the mixture is a weighted average of the octanes of the inputs.

The model uses a binary variable to ensure that production is either zero or at the maximum allowed amount. The objective function is designed to maximize the profit from selling both regular and premium gasoline. The constraints ensure that the octane requirements are met and that production does not exceed the maximum daily limits. The solution provides the optimal quantities of each type of gasoline to produce and the raw materials to purchase. If no optimal solution is found, the code outputs a message indicating this. Otherwise, it displays the maximized profit and the production details. This model and code provide a comprehensive solution to the gasoline blending problem for Solar Oil Company.  **Note:** The code assumes that the binary variable `y` is used to indicate whether any gasoline is produced, and the constraints ensure that if `y` is 1, then at least one unit of gasoline is produced. This approach simplifies the model by avoiding the need for additional binary variables for each type of gasoline. However, if the company wants to produce only one type of gasoline, this approach would need to be modified to include additional binary variables or constraints.  **Note:** The code does not include any constraints to ensure that the production of regular and premium gasoline is non-zero if `y` is 1. This could be added if the company wants to ensure that at least some gasoline is produced if the decision to produce is made.  **Note:** The code assumes that the cost of the additives per barrel is independent of the mixture, which may not be the case in reality. In a real-world scenario, the cost of additives might depend on the mixture, and the model would need to account for this.  **Note:** The code does not include any constraints to ensure that the production of regular and premium gasoline does not exceed the maximum daily demand. This could be added if the company wants to ensure that the production does not exceed the maximum daily demand.  **Note:** The code assumes that the decision variables `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4` represent the number of barrels of raw gasoline purchased, and the decision variables `y1` and `y2` represent the number of barrels of regular and premium gasoline produced.

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nRylon Corporation manufactures Brute and Chanelle perfumes. The raw material needed to manufacture each type of perfume can be purchased for $3 per pound. Processing 1 lb of raw material requires 1 hour of laboratory time. Each pound of processed raw material yields 3 oz of Regular Brute Perfume and 4 oz of Regular Chanelle Perfume. Regular Brute can be sold for $7/oz and Regular Chanelle for $6/oz. Rylon also has the option of further processing Regular Brute and Regular Chanelle to produce Luxury Brute, sold at $18/oz, and Luxury Chanelle, sold at $14/oz. Each ounce of Regular Brute processed further requires an additional 3 hours of laboratory time and $4 processing cost and yields 1 oz of Luxury Brute. Each ounce of Regular Chanelle processed further requires an additional 2 hours of laboratory time and $4 processing cost and yields 1 oz of Luxury Chanelle. Each year, Rylon has 6,000 hours of laboratory time available and can purchase up to 4,000 lb of raw material. Formulate an LP that can be used to determine how Rylon can maximize profits.

{"en_answer": "57.449", "prompt": "Below is an operations research question. Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nStar Oil Company is considering five different investment opportunities. The cash outflows and net present values (NPVs) (in millions of dollars) for each opportunity are given in Table 7. Specifically, Investment 1 has a time 0 cash outflow of $11 million and a time 1 cash outflow of $3 million, with an NPV of $13 million. Investment 2 requires a time 0 outflow of $53 million and a time 1 outflow of $6 million, yielding an NPV of $16 million. Investment 3 has smaller outflows of $5 million at both time 0 and time 1 and also an NPV of $16 million. Investment 4 asks for a time 0 outflow of $5 million and a minimal $1 million at time 1, with an NPV of $14 million. Lastly, Investment 5 requires a $29 million outflow at time 0 and a significant $34 million at time 1, resulting in the highest NPV of $39 million. Star Oil has $40 million available for investment at time 0, and it estimates that $20 million will be available for investment at time 1. Star Oil may purchase any fraction of each investment, in which case, the cash outflows and NPV are adjusted proportionally. For example, if Star Oil purchases one-fifth of investment 3, then a cash outflow of (1/5)*5=1 million dollars or $1 million would be required at time 0, and a cash outflow of (1/5)*5=1 million dollars or $1 million would be required at time 1. The one-fifth share of investment 3 would yield an NPV of (1/5)*16=3.2 million dollars or $3.2 million. Star Oil wants to maximize the NPV that can be obtained by investing in investments 1-5. The goal is to formulate an LP that will help achieve this objective. Assume that any funds left over at time 0 cannot be used at time 1. Find the maximum NPV in million dollars.\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " Mathematical Model and Python Code\n## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the investment problem for Star Oil, we will develop a linear programming model that maximizes the net present value (NPV) of the investments while adhering to the available funds at each time period.

Cash flow constraints at time 0: \\[11x_1 + 53y_1 + 5y_2 + 5y_3 + 29y_4 \\leq 40\\]\n   - This ensures that the total cash outflows at time 0 do not exceed the available funds.\n2. Cash flow constraints at time 1: \\[3x_1 + 6y_1 + 1y_2 + 1y_3 + 34y_4 \\leq 20\\]\n   - This ensures that the total cash outflows at time 1 do not exceed the available funds.\n3.

It defines decision variables for the amounts invested in each investment at each time period, sets the objective function to maximize the NPV, adds constraints for the available funds at each time period, and solves the model. The results include the maximum NPV and the optimal investment amounts for each investment at each time period. This script provides a structured approach to solving the investment problem using linear programming techniques.

The decision variables represent the quantities of each food item, and the objective function minimizes the total cost. Constraints ensure that the nutritional requirements are met. The model is solved using the `coptpy` library, and the results are outputted, showing the minimum cost and the optimal quantities of each food item. This approach provides a cost-effective way to meet dietary needs.  **Note:** The model and code assume that the food items are indivisible, so integer variables are used to ensure feasible solutions. If the food items were divisible, continuous variables could be used.  **Note:** The model and code do not consider any additional constraints such as food availability or storage constraints. If such constraints are relevant, they should be added to the model.  **Note:** The model and code assume that the nutritional requirements are exact, and any surplus or shortage is not considered. If the nutritional requirements are flexible, the model could be modified to include a tolerance or a range for the nutritional values.  **Note:** The model and code do not consider any health or nutritional implications of consuming excessive amounts of certain nutrients. If such implications are relevant, the model could be modified to include additional constraints or penalties for excessive consumption.  **Note:** The model and code assume that the cost of each food item is fixed and does not vary based on the quantity purchased. If the cost varies based on the quantity, the model could be modified to include a cost function that takes into account the quantity purchased.  **Note:** The model and code do not consider any environmental or social impact of the food choices. If such impacts are relevant, the model could be modified to include additional constraints or objectives that take into account these impacts.  **Note:** The model and code assume that the food items are mutually exclusive, meaning that consuming one food item does not affect the nutritional value of another food item. If the food items interact in a way that affects their nutritional value, the model could be modified to include interaction terms.  **Note:** The model and code do not consider any food safety or quality control issues. If such issues are relevant, the model could be modified to include additional constraints or objectives that take into account these issues.  **Note:** The model and code assume that the nutritional values are accurate and reliable.

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nA graph with 10 vertices and a series of edges connecting them. Each vertex is labeled with a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'j'. The vertices labeled 'a', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', and 'j' are colored in red, while 'b', 'e', 'h', and 'i' are colored in blue. The red vertices seem to form a set that covers all the edges of the graph, indicating a solution to the vertex cover problem. The vertex cover problem is a classical optimization problem where the goal is to find the smallest set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The graph itself has a pentagonal structure on the outer edges, with an additional five vertices inside the pentagon that are fully interconnected, forming a complete graph K5 (every vertex inside the pentagon is connected to every other vertex inside). The graph is not planar as there are edges that cross each other. In terms of vertex connections: Vertex 'a' connects to vertices 'f', 'e', and 'b'. Vertex 'b' connect to vertices 'a', 'g', and 'c'. Vertex 'c' connects to vertices 'b', 'h', and 'd'. Vertex 'd' connects to vertices 'c', 'i', and 'e'. Vertex 'e' connects to vertices 'd', 'j', and 'a'. The vertices inside the pentagon ('f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j') are all interconnected. The red-colored vertices ('a', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'j') suggest a possible vertex cover, indicating they are a proposed solution to ensure that all edges of the graph are covered.

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nSemicond is a small electronics company that manufactures tape recorders and radios. The per-unit labor costs for tape recorders and radios are $50 and $35 respectively, and the raw material costs are $30 for tape recorders and $40 for radios. The selling prices are $100 for a tape recorder and $90 for a radio, as outlined in Table 10. On December 1, 2002, Semicond has enough raw material to manufacture 100 tape recorders and 100 radios. On the same date, the company’s balance sheet shows cash at $10,000, accounts receivable at $3,000, and inventory outstanding valued at $7,000, with a bank loan liability of $10,000, resulting in a current ratio of 2 ($20,000 in total assets over $10,000 in liabilities), as shown in Table 11. Semicond must decide how many tape recorders and radios to produce during December, considering that demand is high enough to sell all units produced. Although all sales in December will be on credit, with payment not received until February 1, 2003, Semicond will collect $2,000 in accounts receivable in December. Furthermore, Semicond has to pay off $1,000 of its loan and a monthly rent of $1,000 in December. On January 1, 2003, Semicond will receive raw materials worth $2,000, to be paid for on February 1, 2003. Management has mandated a minimum cash balance of $4,000 for January 1, 2003. Additionally, to satisfy bank requirements, the current ratio on January 1 must be at least 2. Find the maximal contribution to profit from December’s production in $.\n\n# Response:", "en_math_model_coptpy_code": " \n## Mathematical Model:\nTo address the production planning problem for Semcond, we will develop a linear programming model that maximizes the contribution to profit while adhering to the constraints of cash flow, inventory, and production limits.

Cash flow constraint: \\[10000 - 500x_R - 350x_T + 2000 + 2000 - 1000 - 1000 \\geq 4000\\]\n   - This constraint ensures that the total cash available after production, sales, and loan repayment is at least $4,000.\n2. Inventory constraint: \\[7000 - 30x_R - 40x_T + 2000 \\geq 0\\]\n   - This constraint ensures that the total inventory value after production is not less than the initial inventory value.\n3. Production limit constraint: \\[x_R + x_T \\leq 200\\]\n   - This constraint ensures that the total number of units produced does not exceed the production limit.\n4. Current ratio constraint: \\[20000 - 10000 - (50x_R + 35x_T + 30x_R + 40x_T) \\geq 10000\\]\n   - This constraint ensures that the current ratio on January 1, 2003, is at least 2.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x_R, x_T \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as the number of units produced cannot be fractional.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"SemcondProductionPlanning\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx_R = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x_R\")  # Number of tape recorders produced\nx_T = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x_T\")  # Number of radios produced\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective((100*x_R + 90*x_T) - (50*x_R + 35*x_T + 30*x_R + 40*x_T), sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(10000 - 500*x_R - 350*x_T + 2000 + 2000 - 1000 - 1000 >= 4000, name=\"CashFlowConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(7000 - 30*x_R - 40*x_T + 2000 >= 0, name=\"InventoryConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(x_R + x_T <= 200, name=\"ProductionLimitConstraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(20000 - 10000 - (50*x_R + 35*x_T + 30*x_R + 40*x_T) >= 10000, name=\"CurrentRatioConstraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximal contribution to profit: ${:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of tape recorders produced: {:.0f}\".format(x_R.x))\n    print(\"Number of radios produced: {:.0f}\".format(x_T.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis Python script uses the `coptpy` library to solve the production planning problem for Semcond. The script first creates a COPT environment and model, then adds decision variables for the number of tape recorders and radios produced. The objective function is set to maximize the contribution to profit, considering both revenue and costs. Constraints are added to ensure cash flow, inventory, production limits, and current ratio requirements. Finally, the model is solved, and the results are output, showing the maximal contribution to profit and the optimal production quantities. This solution helps Semcond maximize its profit while adhering to financial and production constraints.  **Note:** The script assumes that the raw materials worth $2,000 received on January 1, 2003, will be paid for on February 1, 2003, which is not explicitly stated in the problem description.
